# Warlords


>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;  <br />
>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,  <br />
>The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere  <br />
>The ceremony of innocence is drowned;  <br />
>The best lack all conviction, while the worst  <br />
>Are full of passionate intensity. <br />  <br />
> W. B. Yeats, The Second Coming

Warlords is a sandbox set in the Warlord era / civil war of China (1916 - 1949).

Some influences include:

- Victoria 2
- Tactical Combat Series
- Battle Brothers

I am open to adding additional developers to the project. You may reach me at:

It is written in Python and uses the Arcade game engine.

I hope to release before the end of this year.
